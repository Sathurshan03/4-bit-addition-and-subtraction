# 4-bit-addition-and-subtraction
I have made a 4 bit addition and subtraction circuit. It uses a multiplexer to chose between the two operations. This circuit also has a memory component using J-k flip flop. I made this on DigitalWorks.exe.
I have also included a screenshot of the entire circuit too.
